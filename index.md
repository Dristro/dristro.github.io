Hey there, I'm **Dhruv** ðŸ‘‹  
A curious builder, deep learning enthusiast, and part-time RC car hacker.

This space is where I share my:
- Experiments with deep learning models (built from scratch, usually)
- Custom 3D-printed RC car projects and hardware tinkering
- Thoughts, ideas, and learnings from exploring tech hands-on

> I like figuring out how things work â€” and then pushing them until they break in interesting ways.

Thanks for dropping by!  
Feel free to check out my [projects](/projects), read a [blog post](/blog), or [reach out](mailto:dhruvn853@gmail.com).
