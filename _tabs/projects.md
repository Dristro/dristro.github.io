Here are some of the things I’ve built — usually from scratch, just the way I like it  

---

### Deep Learning
Explorations in frameworks, NLP, and training workflows.

#### [PureTorch](https://github.com/Dristro/PureTorch)
A PyTorch-like deep learning framework implemented from the ground up.  
Focuses on building autograd, tensor ops, and training loops with minimal dependencies.

#### [Inqueropedia](https://github.com/Dristro/Inqueropedia)
A Wikipedia-powered chatbot that uses custom tokenization and search — no pre-trained models or black boxes.  
Still in the works — currently figuring out a way to train the model :(

### Deployment Demos
Live demos hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

#### [Food Classifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Dristro/food_classifier)
An EfficientNet-B2 model to classify between 3 food types: pizza, steak, sushi.

#### [Food Classifier 101](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Dristro/food101_classifier)
Trained on a 20% subset of the Food101 dataset.  
Achieved a 1.59% improvement in top-1 accuracy over the original paper's baseline.

### Deep Learning Paper Replications
Replicating deep-learning papers from scratch.

#### Vision Transformer (ViT)
A faithful implementation of the [ViT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), built layer-by-layer with annotated code and experiments.

#### Attention Is All You Need (Transformer)
Recreated the original Transformer architecture from scratch, focusing on attention mechanisms and positional encoding.

#### Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (ResNet)
Replicating the work from the [ResNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) on the tiny-imagenet dataset.
Still in progress — model training and evaluation ongoing.

### Hardware & RC Cars

#### 3D-Printed RC Builds
Designed and built multiple RC cars using Fusion 360, custom chassis, and open-source electronics.  
Some builds use salvaged parts, others are entirely custom.

---

### Side Quests

#### Planner App (JavaFX)
A small productivity tool written in Java, built to manage tasks and deadlines with a clean desktop UI.

<!-- TODO: Add demo images or writeups for each project -->
