Hi, Iâ€™m **Dhruv** ðŸ‘‹  
I like to build deep learning models from scratch, hack on RC cars, and break things to learn how they work.

This site is where I write, tinker, and document side quests â€” both successful and chaotic.

- Interested in deep learning internals and system-level tinkering
- Passionate about DIY hardware builds
- Always up for discussing ideas or projects

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:dhruvn853@gmail.com) or [connect on GitHub](https://github.com/Dristro)
